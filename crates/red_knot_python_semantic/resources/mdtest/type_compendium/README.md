# Type compendium

The type compendium contains "fact sheets" about important, interesting, and peculiar types in (Red
Knot's interpretation of) Python's type system. It is meant to be an educational reference for
developers and users of Red Knot. It is also a living document that ensures that our implementation
of these types and their properties is consistent with the specification.
